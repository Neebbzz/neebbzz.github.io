The excitement began 15 years ago when those electrifying "Birds" came down like rolling thunder to capture the hearts of enthusiasts everywhere. And a legend was born. 

Now comes the road machine that will fire-up a new generation!

From saber-like nose to rakish taill, Trans Am is a brilliant orchestration of aerodynamic function. Its .31 drag coefficient is the best of any production car GM has ever tested. 

But the new Trans Am is much more than a beautiful piece of automotive sculpture. It's a driver's car that's totally engineered for serious roadwork. 

Trans Am with options shown, $10,076. Trans Am's base price? Only $9,659! This is a manufacturer's suggested retail price including dealer prep, Taxes, license, destination charges and optional equipment additional. One "hands-on" impression will convince you that Trans Am is a driving sensation!

The legend makers at Pontiac have done it again!
